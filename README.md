Vue 3 Playground stands as a learning project for those who want to get familiar with [the new features of Vue 3](https://composition-api.vuejs.org/).

Currently new features include reactivity, Composition Api and plugins.

The application is a shopping cart where you can alter the name, price and quantity of the products and
recalculates the total price based on the items and used coupon.
